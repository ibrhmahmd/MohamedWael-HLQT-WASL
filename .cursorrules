# HLQT WASL Project Intelligence

## Project Context
- HLQT WASL is a comprehensive city guide for Kafr El-Sheikh (KFS)
- The project serves as a local directory for restaurants, hospitals, and services
- It includes user authentication with social media options
- The application focuses on providing detailed information about local establishments

## Project Structure Patterns
- The project follows a clear separation between website pages (`src/website`) and reusable components (`src/main`)
- Content is organized by service categories in `src/website/web/content`
- Each service category has its own subdirectory with specific pages
- Assets are organized into subdirectories (css, js, imgs, icons)
- Service-specific assets are stored within each service category directory

## Component Organization
- Each UI component has its own directory in `src/main` with HTML, CSS, and JS files
- Components include: navbar, cards, footer, loadingScreen, alerts, swiper, toTopBtn
- Default styling is managed separately in `defaultStyling`
- Components are imported via script tags at the bottom of HTML files
- Card components are used consistently for service listings

## Code Style Observations
- HTML5 semantic markup is used for page structure
- FontAwesome 6.7.2 is used consistently for icons
- CSS classes follow a descriptive naming convention
- JavaScript is organized by component functionality
- Mobile-first responsive design with media queries
- Consistent structure for service listing pages

## Service Implementation
- **Restaurants**: Directory with individual restaurant pages (Pizza Pan, Chickers, KFC, etc.)
- **Hospitals**: Directory with individual hospital pages (General Hospital, University Hospital, etc.)
- **Services**: Marketplace with various service categories (delivery, medical, internet, etc.)
- **Tourism**: Coming soon section for tourism attractions
- **Contact Form**: User feedback system with form validation

## Content Patterns
- Each service category follows a consistent layout:
  1. Header with navigation
  2. Image slider showcasing the category
  3. Card-based directory of services
  4. Footer with social links
- Status indicators for content availability:
  - "Coming Soon" for upcoming features
  - Error indicators for unavailable content
- Individual service pages provide detailed information about specific establishments

## Project Evolution
- Memory bank documentation has been updated with detailed content analysis
- Service categories and organization have been documented
- User journeys across different service types have been mapped
